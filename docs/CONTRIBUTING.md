# Contribution Guide

Contribution of any kind would be highly appreciated! If you have any specific questions, don't hesitate to open a discussion, reach out to me on Github directly, or email me at `cassfunen@gmail.com`, I will do my best to response quickly.

## Basics

The `main` branch is considered the 'stable' or 'release' branch, changes in `main` only comes with pull requests from the `dev` branch. The `dev` branch is considered the 'development' branch, where new features and bug fixes are implemented and tested, before being added to the stable branch.

To make any changes, first fork from the `dev` branch. Make sure it's up to date, at this stage I make very frequent and violent changes to everything, so it might not take long for your local code to be completely incompatible. Please also include test scripts for the changes.

Once you're ready, make a pull request to the current `dev` branch, once approved, the changes will be merged.

## Bug Fixes

As mentioned, AutoMoonBot is still super alpha and likely full of bugs. If you would like to fix an existing or newly discovered bug, go ahead and implement a fix, no discussions required. 

## Help Implement Incomplete Features

At this stage, many features are either incomplete or sub-optimal. Contribution in this category is highly appreciated. Check out [`FEATURES`](docs/FEATURES.md) for more information.

## Brand New Features

If you have ideas on new features, please open a discussion first, the project might be heading to a different direction entirely.
