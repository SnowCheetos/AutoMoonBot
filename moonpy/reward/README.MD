# Reward Function

Reward functions are the bread and butter of any reinforcement learning algorithm. It is what makes the agent learn and improve. A poorly defined reward function can result in *reward hacking*, when the agent finds a way to achieve high rewards through unintended or undesired behavior rather than by performing the task in the intended manner.



## Reward Sparsity

Reinforcement Learning faces several challenges when dealing with sparse rewards, which occur when rewards are infrequent or delayed. Sparse rewards can significantly complicate the learning process for an agent.

## Reward Shaping

Reward shaping is a mechanism that aims to mitigate some of the issues faced with sparse rewards, by providing additional intermediate rewards that guide the agent towards the final goal.
